# DataFest Competition 2023

UCLA DataFest is a data analytics hackathon where teams have 48 hours to provide the best insights gleaned from a large, complex dataset.

This year the prompt was about American Bar Association and their free, online attorney service.  The dataset had information on where the attornies are from, where the client are from, the question asked, and so much more.  The goal of this project was to find something within the dataset that would be useful to the American Bar Association.
